The future is not a place we go to. It's one we reclaim...

In a world increasingly drawn to sameness, there is something radical, revolutionary, about being deeply rooted.

As Zimbabweans, as Africans, we sit on a goldmine of artistic heritage: instruments that speak in ancestral tongues, clothing that carries symbols of community and spirit, poetry born from oral legacy.

And yet, many of us are taught to see it all as “backward,” something to outgrow. But what if we didn’t run away from our roots? What if we ran toward them, and built something entirely new?

---

Imagine a theatre where the sounds of the **mbira** aren't just in the background, but center stage. Its resonant polyphony, woven with that of **hosho** and the grounded beat of the **ngoma**.

Now imagine these sacred sounds in conversation with violins, ambient synths, digital pads — each voice adding to, not erasing, the other.

What if we didn’t just include African instruments in orchestras — what if we built entire symphonies around them?

Let the **mbira** lead. Let the **marimba** set the tempo for **amapiano**, for **Afro-soul**, for even **trap beats**. Let our sound tell today’s stories, and also use the power of our language.

---

**Hope Masike** wears **retso** with pride, plays the **mbira**, sings in **Shona**, and reminds us that tradition is not something behind us, but something alive.

**Jah Prayzah** infuses **mbira** into his music and wraps **Shona** lyrics around contemporary rhythms, bridging village spirit with global sound.

**Ivhu-Tribe** reimagines ancestral wear with modern silhouettes, proving that history doesn’t belong in museums.

And it’s not just in our music or fashion — our languages themselves carry the seeds of this future.

---

Shona and other Bantu languages have **music** in them. **Magic**. 

**Tsumo dzedu chaidzo** (our proverbs) carry philosophies that rival any textbook. **Nyaudzosingwi** reveals intricate metaphors embedded in the way we think.

**Shona** isn’t a broken version of English — it is a system of linguistic architecture.

If you’ve ever taken Shona classes, you might remember **misambo**. I once wondered what the point was. But then I realized: we were learning to see our language as an engine.

From a single root `nhu`, we generate:

- munhu (a person)  
- vanhu (people)  
- chinhu (a thing)  
- zvinhu (things)  

The logic is algebraic. The structure is intentional.

Swahili: *mtu → watu*.  
Zulu: *umuntu → abantu*.  
Chichewa: *munthu → anthu*.

Not coincidence… **design**. Thought, spirit, identity — engineered into grammar.

Our tongues are not “vernacular.” They are **art**. They are **philosophy**.

---

If this is what’s hidden in everyday language, what more lies in **totem praise poetry**?

What would it mean to welcome a newborn not just with a certificate, but with a praise song?

> “Titambirei Soko Mukanya, Makwiramiti, Mahomu-homu, vanopona nezve kuba…”

What if we said farewell with the same sacred words?

These are not mere traditions. They are **living archives**. They hold our history, our identity, our soul.

---

I am **Soko Mukanya**. And I wear it with pride. Not as an animal, but as an ancestral symbol, of kinship, memory, and mystery.

I remember history classes, and names like **Chibatamatosi** and **Matope**. At first I laughed… how could a king be called *Chibatamatosi* (the one who holds snot)?

But then I understood. We named with **meaning**. We preserved history not with pens, but with names — **stories etched into language**.

Names should tell stories, but nowadays, people look for beautiful baby names on Google.

Mine is **Elton**. I googled it and found little of meaning.

We’ve lost our way of naming with intention.

We now choose names for how they roll off the tongue, not for what they root us in.

I feel like names should come from stories, our struggles, our joys, our lineages.

And maybe names like **Ability**, **Charity**, or **Saymore** — names that some laugh at — aren’t just quirks.

Maybe they’re subconscious attempts to **reclaim meaning**. To speak **purpose back into identity**.  
Maybe, even in their oddness, they are more honest than names borrowed without meaning.

---

I recently saw clips from *Shaka iLembe*, and I was struck — not just by the visuals, but by how boldly it dared to show us to ourselves.

Bare-breasted women. Men with exposed curves.

At first it felt uncomfortable. Maybe even wrong. Why?

Because somewhere along the way, **our own skin became shameful**.  
**Our language became “uneducated.”**  
**Our customs became “backward.”**  
**Our spirituality became “evil.”**

We became strangers to ourselves, taught to watch our own lives through foreign eyes.

---

We need stories that are bold enough to tell the truth.

That this is who we were.  
That this is what was.

Because in remembering, we **reclaim**.

And we must be careful, too, of letting others tell our stories.

**Film is memory reconstruction.**

And when African accents are butchered in movies, or when our cultures are flattened into exotic caricature, it matters.

Racism won’t end with slogans alone.  
It ends when we live in **full ownership of who we are** — when our art, our speech, our spirit, stands **unapologetically** in its fullness.

---

Let’s be honest: the reason we didn’t build ships to colonize others was not because we were “behind.”  
It’s because we were **fulfilled**.

We didn’t hunger to conquer.  
We had gold, and knew it didn’t need to become currency.

We had systems of law, systems of healing, systems of education — passed not through ink, but through **spirit, story, and song**.

We were not behind. We were uninterested in domination.

But conquest is born from lack.

And so they came. They took. They renamed. We watched. We knelt.

---

Even now in 2025, forty-five years after independence, I firmly believe that the average person walking in Harare is living **way worse** than the average person from the times before colonial rule.

And it is only getting worse.

Now we have washed-down versions of our own culture with the recent surge in **Manjuzu** who have absolutely no idea of what they are doing, or if it is even the right thing.

Must we stay in the disorder? The Chaos?

---

It is time to return.

To move forward, we must look back.  
Let the future begin at the **root**.

---

Africa’s gift to the world was never empire — it was **spiritual clarity**.

We knew God before theology.  
We poured beer on the earth for our ancestors.  
We knelt before trees.  
We felt the divine in the rain.  
We had communion before cathedrals.

And for this, they called us primitive?

---

**Progress is not Wi-Fi. Not skyscrapers. Not bullet trains.**

**Progress is peace. Progress is balance.**

Progress is living without being severed from your **soil**, your **spirit**, your **story**.

---

Let us return.

Let us wear **retso** and not whisper about those who do.  
Let us cry at the sound of the **mbira** and not feel strange.  
Let us teach our wisdom to our children.

Let us build art from within, not from imitation.

Let us reclaim what was interrupted.
